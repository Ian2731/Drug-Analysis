With data on different pharmaceutical drugs I analyzed the data to show how four treatments (Capomulin, Infubinol, Ketapril, and Placebo) compare.

To do this I:
  -Created a scatter plot that shows how the tumor volume changes over time for each treatment
  -Created a scatter plot that shows how the number of metastatic (cancer spreading) sites changes over time for each treatment
  -Created a scatter plot that shows the number of mice still alive through the course of treatment (Survival Rate)
